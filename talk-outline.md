Start with <h1>Hello World</h1>
Initialize git with `git init`
Demo `git add -A` and `git commit -m` by changing index.html

Git doesn't automatically track files. That's good because you might not want git tracking _every_ single file.

`git add`

Create a GitHub repository and push to it
Have someone clone it and push a change to `master`
Pull to see their changes
Make a branch-model pull request (PR) reversing the change
Have someone approve it and merge PR
Both of you pull changes
Make a fork-model PR adding another change
Have someone approve it and merge PR
